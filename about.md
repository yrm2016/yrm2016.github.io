## General information

**The ETSF Young researchers' Meeting (YRM)** is a series of conference held annually under the auspices of the European Theoretical Spectroscopy Facility (ETSF). It brings together young researchers (PhD students and postdocs) working in the field of ab-initio solid-state physics and gives them an opportunity to present their work to an international audience. All young researchers are invited to apply through the YRM2016 webpage and submit an abstract for a poster or an oral contribution.

Each session will be open with a keynote talk introducing a general overview and the main challenges of the topic. To give young researchers opportunity to discover the industrial world the first day will be dedicated to presentations from researchers in industry.

The talks are divided in thematic sessions. In order to make them accessible even to students working on different areas, every session is opened by a key-note speaker who is entitled to give a broad and didactic introduction to the theory and the method inherent to the field. He/she also have to introduce concepts that will be developed in the successive talks of the session.

One day of the workshop is devoted to the research in industry. Several talks are given by people who switched from the research in academia to the private sector. This gives attendees a unique opportunity to compare the research activity in the two domains, to structure their career and to envisage outreach collaborations.

YRM 2016 will be held at the Strand Campus of **King’s College London** (KCL) in London, UK on **6 – 10 of June 2016**.

1. The main topics of YRM 2015 are:
1. Strongly Correlated Electrons
1. Spectroscopy and dielectric properties
1. Magnetic properties and their dynamics
1. Phonon, vibrations and thermal properties
1. When the environment matters

## What is the ETSF?

The European Theoretical Spectroscopy Facility (ETSF) (www.etsf.eu) is a knowledge center for theoretical spectroscopy carrying out state-of-the-art research on theoretical and computational methods for studying electronic and optical properties of materials. This network comprises many facilities and laboratories in Europe performing research in solid-state physics, encouraging the collaboration among research teams. Besides theoretical development, it aims to strengthen the link to experimental groups and industrial research.
