## General information

**The ETSF Young researchers' Meeting (YRM)** is a series of conferences held annually under the auspices of the European Theoretical Spectroscopy Facility (ETSF). It brings together young researchers (PhD students and postdocs) working in the field of ab-initio electronic structure of real materials and gives them an opportunity to present their work to an international audience. All young researchers are invited to apply through the ETSF YRM 2016 web-page and submit an abstract for a poster or an oral contribution.

The talks are divided in thematic sessions. In order to make them accessible even to students working on different areas, every session is opened by a key-note speaker who is entitled to give a broad and didactic introduction to the theory and the method inherent to the field. He/she also have to introduce concepts that will be developed in the successive talks of the session.

To give young scientists opportunity to discover research in the private sector, the first day will be dedicated to presentations from industrial researchers. This gives attendees a unique opportunity to compare the research activity in the two domains, to structure their career and to envisage outreach collaborations.

## What is the ETSF?

The European Theoretical Spectroscopy Facility (ETSF) (www.etsf.eu) is a knowledge center for theoretical spectroscopy carrying out state-of-the-art research on theoretical and computational methods for studying electronic and optical properties of materials. This network comprises many facilities and laboratories in Europe and USA performing research in real materials, encouraging the collaboration among research teams. Besides theoretical development, it aims to strengthen the link to experimental groups and industrial research.
