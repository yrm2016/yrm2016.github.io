YRM2015
========

The ETSF Young researchers' Meeting (YRM) is a series of conference held annually under the auspices of the European Theoretical Spectroscopy Facility (ETSF). It brings together young researchers (PhD students and postdocs) working in the field of ab-initio solid-state physics and gives them an opportunity to present their work to an international audience. All young researchers are invited to apply through the YRM2016 webpage and submit an abstract for a poster or an oral contribution.

Each session will be open with a keynote talk introducing a general overview and the main challenges of the topic. To give young researchers opportunity to discover the industrial world the first day will be dedicated to presentations from researchers in industry.

YRM 2016 will be held at the Strand Campus of Kingâ€™s College London (KCL) in London, UK on 6 - 10 June.
